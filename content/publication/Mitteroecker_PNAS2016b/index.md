abstract: The strikingly high incidence of obstructed labor due to the disproportion of fetal size and the motherâ€™s pelvic dimensions has puzzled evolutionary scientists for decades. Here we propose that these high rates are a direct consequence of the distinct characteristics of human obstetric selection. Neonatal size relative to the birth-relevant maternal dimensions is highly variable
