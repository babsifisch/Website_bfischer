I am an evolutionary biologist and data scientist with a background in mathematics and theoretical biology. My research focuses on the evolution of birth in humans. I am an Elise Richter fellow at the [Unit of Theoretical Biology](https://theoretical.univie.ac.at/), [Department of Evolutionary Biology](https://evolution.univie.ac.at/) of the University of Vienna, Austria. In addition to my research, I consider [teaching](#teaching) and [communicating science](#media) important parts of my work. I enjoy giving popular science talks as well as writing articles for a general audience and I have authored a [textbook for high school biology](https://www.oebv.at/lehrwerke/am-puls).
